 <h2>My favorite - Alan Shearer</h2>
 <br>One of England’s greatest ever strikers, he is still the Premier League and Newcastle United’s record goalscorer.<br>

His career started at Southampton where he scored a hat-trick on his debut. He moved to Blackburn Rovers where his goals helped them to win the Premier League title in the 1994-95 season. A world record £15m transfer fee saw him return to the north-east and Newcastle United where he stayed until he retired in 2006.<br>

Alan was capped 63 times for England and scored 30 goals. He was named PFA Player of the year twice.<br>

He now has a highly successful media career working for the BBC, Five Live and the Premier League covering the Premier League and FA Cup. He is an ambassador for Speedflex, a high intensity cardio and resistance training concept and alongside his work for his own Alan Shearer Foundation he supports the Sir Bobby Robson Foundation, CHUF and the NSPCC.<br>

Alan is an accomplished 6 handicap golfer and Callaway ambassador and founder member at Close House Golf Club in Newcastle.</p>
